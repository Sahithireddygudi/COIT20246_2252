# **Ethical and Social issues**
The customers with Truelec personal information, project requirements and staff information. The key concerns of ethics are connected with privacy of the data, legality of data (use and security measures) and data protection measures. The business organization has to adhere to the regulations of the Australian Privacy Act of 1988 and the scheme of Notifiable Data Breaches. Sensitive customer information thrown away would lead to identity theft, customer loss or reputational damage. The company can mitigate these worries by adopting privacy-by-design principles, implementing sever retention policy and telling customers whether, how, or why their data are used. I have mentioned the OAIC guidelines and Privacy Act in my report.

To mitigate these:

- They should use privacy-by-design, during the design of IT systems and networks.
- They should also have a firm data retention and disposal policy such that unwanted data is destroyed under security.
- They must ensure effective communication to customers on why, how and why their data is collected and used, which is in line with OAIC (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner) guidelines.

This would help Truelec be ethically responsible, retain customer confidence and help in minimizing legal liability, by embedding the practices in the operation.
